## Here is the background information on your task

*  It is now time to get started with some machine learning!
*  The client has provided 3 datasets, it is now your job to combine, transform and model these datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement that the business has requested.
*  Most importantly, once the modeling process is complete, we need you to communicate your work and analysis in the form of a single PowerPoint slide, so that we can present the results back to the business.
* The key here is to use business-friendly language and to explain your results in a way that the business will understand. For example, ensure that when you’re summarizing the performance of the results you don’t use technical metrics, but rather convert it into numbers that they’ll understand. 

## Dataset
* Uploaded unto Mysql Database so that it would be effificent to add new data in future.
* Table Description:
1. sales = sales data
2. sensor_storage_temperature = IoT data from the temperature sensors in the storage facility for the products
3. sensor_stock_levels = estimated stock levels of products based on IoT sensors

* Merged the three datasets, preprocessed and then transformed ready for modelling.

## Model Summary
* Here is the [Model Summary](https://github.com/Swam80/Cognizant_AI_Internship_Forage/blob/main/Task%203/Model%20Summary.pdf)

## Conclusion
* Model performance is poor. Need more data so that the model learns the timely pattern of stock levels.
* Data we used was for one weeks time, maybe yearly data would give better insights.
* Also, IOT data seems to be very important.
